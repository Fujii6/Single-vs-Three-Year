To address the challenges of low reported mortality rates for cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in the U.S., the team developed a strategy to aggregate data across three years using a spatial modeling approach. While this method improved estimate reliability, the public and policymakers often preferred single-year estimates for decision-making. To bridge this gap, new models were constructed to generate single-year estimates with reliability comparable to three-year estimates.

My role in this project was to compare the two estimation approaches by creating a visualization report that analyzed their differences. The estimates were generated using Bayesian and spatial models, making direct comparisons complex. To assess their reliability, I first examined the number of counties where estimates were suppressed due to insufficient data. Additionally, I analyzed the distribution of rates to determine how much single-year estimates deviated from the three-year model. This comparison helped evaluate the feasibility of using single-year estimates while maintaining statistical reliability for public health reporting.
